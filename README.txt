Custom Armor Test Mod
Minecraft 1.4.7
Minecraft Forge 6.6.0.497

This is the source code for a Custom Armor Test Mod to be used with Forge.
Please import this directory's contents to \forge\mcp\src\minecraft\mod\customarmortest using Eclipse.

This achieves custom armor rendering, however the files:

test_1.png
test_2.png
testalt_1.png
testalt_2.png

must be placed within \forge\mcp\jars\bin\minecraft.jar\armor for this to properly work. I don't know of a way currently to achieve custom armor rendering without altering the .jar at this time, however this should be of help for those who wish to understand how to make this work in the first place.

The Mod is not written with MultiPlayer in mind, so there is no supplied server-side coding.
